Without getting too technical up front, imagine that traditional web solutions are built as a single location solution. They require things you see on your screen right now but also are highly tied to \"back-end\" software that makes the experience work for you.</p>\n<p>Headless means that the focus of HAX is on the front-end web user experience only. It has very little if any tie to a \"back-end\".&#160;<span>This design constraint forces the development community to build the tool in such a way that it's highly portable to any environment, fast, small, and easy to maintain.</span></p>\n<h3 data-original-level=\"H3\" id=\"header-21ba0126-6371-baef-b617-3602691a7241\">Authoring</h3>\n<p>The focus of HAX is on the author, specifically, content authors. Traditional Content management system (CMS) environments focus on management of content. The organization, storage, retrieval, and presentation of material are paramount to the way in which authors actually work with the solution.</p>\n<p>By focusing on authors directly we are able to craft solutions that better meet the needs of users that know how to open up a text editor and start writing. HAX blocks and editing tools are engineered to empower authors because the management and storage of material are semantic, simple, and portable.</p>\n<h3 data-original-level=\"H3\" id=\"header-6170e9da-75d6-83ec-27e6-7166fecad6b5\">eXperience</h3>\n<p>The experience you have while using any system makes or breaks what you will create with the tool. By focusing on user experience, especially authoring experience as to how content creators implement and present content, we're able to provide the highest quality experience possible.</p>\n<p>HAX core audience is focused on people that know the internet exists but not how it works. As a result HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are pushed to the background. While everything you write in HAX is made of these technologies you shouldn't have to know anything about them in order to be creative on the web.</p>\n<h3 data-original-level=\"H3\" id=\"header-5aa7998b-4267-361a-b1cf-6c702ed3efb6\">Go forth and web</h3>\n<p>From here, it's up to you to build the best web you can.

At just under 13\n      minutes in length, the duration is slightly (but not overly) long. Similar to Peter\n      Aeschbacher, the lecture is carefully planned and sequenced, with narration written\n      to be spoken, no extraneous content, and features timely presentation of new visuals\n      planned in advance.\n      <p></p>\n    </p=\"true\"=\"\">\n  </a11y-collapse>\n\n  <a11y-collapse heading=\"Delivery and Overall Assessment\" heading-button slot=\"col-2\" icon=\"icons:expand-more\" tooltip=\"expand\" label=\"expand\" background-color=\"light-blue\" accent-color=\"grey\">\n    <p=\"true\"=\"\">Additionally, Bonj models a natural delivery with a good rate of speech and inflection.\n      This video strongly follows Cognitive Load Theory, fosters student engagement, includes\n      a solid design for active learning, and exemplifies excellent content planning, slide\n      creation, and lecture recording.\n      <p></p>\n    </p=\"true\"=\"\">\n  </a11y-collapse>\n\n  <a11y-collapse heading=\"Instructional Goal and Strategy\" heading-button slot=\"col-1\" icon=\"icons:expand-more\" tooltip=\"expand\" label=\"expand\" background-color=\"light-blue\" accent-color=\"grey\">\n    <p=\"true\"=\"\">In examining Monticello, Bonj's instructional goal is for students to view Jefferson's\n      design as the product of his attempt to create a unique design style reflective of\n      the new nation.

The first is found in the\n      video itself. She is a natural storyteller who knows exactly where she wants to take\n      you. What she chooses to show is fascinating; she uses graphic overlays, text, and\n      other visual cues to constantly guide the viewer; and her narration is excellent\n      in maintaining interest.The second source is too rarely seen. Consistent with the\n      guidelines to maximize student learning (see Brame's design for active learning),\n      every LARCH 060 lecture is associated with one or more Check Your Understanding questions.\n      These \"no stakes\" interactive questions allow students to test their understanding,\n      providing useful feedback to direct student interaction with the video.\n      <p></p>\n    </p=\"true\"=\"\">\n  </a11y-collapse>\n\n</grid-plate>\n<video-player id=\"node-6151\" source=\"https://youtu.be/WQGzmmf8Xbo\" class=\"iframe node node-external-video contextual-links-region node-view-mode-iframe\" accent-color=\"orange\" sticky-corner=\"none\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" resource=\"#37b27c70-0c34-b297-5b1d-e060ac25977d\" prefix=\"oer:http://oerschema.org/ schema:http://schema.org/ dc:http://purl.org/dc/terms/ foaf:http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ cc:http://creativecommons.org/ns# bib:http://bib.schema.org \" element-visible t=\"{&quot;embeddedMedia&quot;:&quot;embedded media&quot;}\" source-type=\"youtube\" lang=\"en\" sources=\"[]\" source-data=\"[{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WQGzmmf8Xbo&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;&quot;}]\" tracks=\"[{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://media.aanda.psu.edu/sites/media/aa/files/captions/16_2_jeffersondecisions.vtt&quot;,&quot;srclang&quot;:&quot;en&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;English&quot;,&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;subtitles&quot;}]\" media-title=\"Jefferson's Decisions and Monticello\" text-align=\"center\" style=\"background-color: var(--simple-colors-default-theme-null-1);

Lastly,\n      the two Check Your Understanding questions help students connect the design features\n      at Versailles with their significance.\n      <p></p>\n    </p=\"true\"=\"\">\n  </a11y-collapse>\n\n</grid-plate>\n<video-player id=\"node-3295\" class=\"entity_iframe entity_iframe_node entity_iframe_tool_elmsmedia elmsmedia_video node node-video contextual-links-region node-view-mode-iframe iframe\" accent-color=\"red\" sticky-corner=\"none\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" source=\"https://youtu.be/opqCJphYD-w\" track=\"https://media.aanda.psu.edu/sites/media/aa/files/captions/10_4_versailles_1.vtt\" resource=\"#a00f20a7-fa00-3c1d-54d9-f337d4d04d28\" prefix=\"oer:http://oerschema.org/ schema:http://schema.org/ dc:http://purl.org/dc/terms/ foaf:http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ cc:http://creativecommons.org/ns# bib:http://bib.schema.org \" t=\"{&quot;embeddedMedia&quot;:&quot;embedded media&quot;}\" source-type=\"youtube\" lang=\"en\" sources=\"[]\" source-data=\"[{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/opqCJphYD-w&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;&quot;}]\" tracks=\"[]\" element-visible thumbnail-src=\"files/Bonj 2.jpg\" media-title=\"Versailles\" text-align=\"center\" style=\"background-color: var(--simple-colors-default-theme-null-1);

Similar to Peter\n      Aeschbacher, the lecture is carefully planned and sequenced, with narration written\n      to be spoken, no extraneous content, and features timely presentation of new visuals\n      planned in advance.\n      <p></p>\n    </p=\"true\"=\"\">\n  </a11y-collapse>\n\n\n\n  <a11y-collapse heading=\"Delivery and Overall Assessment\" heading-button slot=\"col-2\" icon=\"icons:expand-more\" tooltip=\"expand\" label=\"expand\" background-color=\"light-blue\" accent-color=\"grey\">\n    <p=\"true\"=\"\">Additionally, Bonj models a natural delivery with a good rate of speech and inflection.\n      This video strongly follows Cognitive Load Theory, fosters student engagement, includes\n      a solid design for active learning, and exemplifies excellent content planning, slide\n      creation, and lecture recording.\n      <p></p>\n    </p=\"true\"=\"\">\n  </a11y-collapse>\n\n\n\n  <a11y-collapse heading=\"Instructional Goal and Strategy\" heading-button slot=\"col-1\" icon=\"icons:expand-more\" tooltip=\"expand\" label=\"expand\" background-color=\"light-blue\" accent-color=\"grey\">\n    <p=\"true\"=\"\">In examining Monticello, Bonj's instructional goal is for students to view Jefferson's\n      design as the product of his attempt to create a unique design style reflective of\n      the new nation. Her strategy is to trace his use and adaptation of Roman architecture\n      and the English Landscape School to arrive at an entirely new American style.\n      <p></p>\n    </p=\"true\"=\"\">\n  </a11y-collapse>\n\n\n\n  <a11y-collapse heading=\"Strong Student Engagement\" heading-button slot=\"col-1\" icon=\"icons:expand-more\" tooltip=\"expand\" label=\"expand\" background-color=\"light-blue\" accent-color=\"grey\">\n    <p=\"true\"=\"\" role=\"textbox\">Bonj's strong student engagement stems from two sources. The first is found in the\n      video itself. She is a natural storyteller who knows exactly where she wants to take\n      you. What she chooses to show is fascinating; she uses graphic overlays, text, and\n      other visual cues to constantly guide the viewer; and her narration is excellent\n      in maintaining interest.The second source is too rarely seen. Consistent with the\n      guidelines to maximize student learning (see Brame's design for active learning),\n      every LARCH 060 lecture is associated with one or more Check Your Understanding questions.\n      These \"no stakes\" interactive questions allow students to test their understanding,\n      providing useful feedback to direct student interaction with the video.\n      <p></p>\n

Similar to Peter\n      Aeschbacher, the lecture is carefully planned and sequenced, with narration written\n      to be spoken, no extraneous content, and features timely presentation of new visuals\n      planned in advance.\n      <p></p>\n    </p=\"true\"=\"\">\n  </a11y-collapse>\n\n\n\n  <a11y-collapse heading=\"Delivery and Overall Assessment\" heading-button slot=\"col-2\" icon=\"icons:expand-more\" tooltip=\"expand\" label=\"expand\" background-color=\"light-blue\" accent-color=\"grey\">\n    <p=\"true\"=\"\">Additionally, Bonj models a natural delivery with a good rate of speech and inflection.\n      This video strongly follows Cognitive Load Theory, fosters student engagement, includes\n      a solid design for active learning, and exemplifies excellent content planning, slide\n      creation, and lecture recording.\n      <p></p>\n    </p=\"true\"=\"\">\n  </a11y-collapse>\n\n\n\n  <a11y-collapse heading=\"Instructional Goal and Strategy\" heading-button slot=\"col-1\" icon=\"icons:expand-more\" tooltip=\"expand\" label=\"expand\" background-color=\"light-blue\" accent-color=\"grey\">\n    <p=\"true\"=\"\">In examining Monticello, Bonj's instructional goal is for students to view Jefferson's\n      design as the product of his attempt to create a unique design style reflective of\n      the new nation. Her strategy is to trace his use and adaptation of Roman architecture\n      and the English Landscape School to arrive at an entirely new American style.\n      <p></p>\n    </p=\"true\"=\"\">\n  </a11y-collapse>\n\n\n\n  <a11y-collapse heading=\"Strong Student Engagement\" heading-button slot=\"col-1\" icon=\"icons:expand-more\" tooltip=\"expand\" label=\"expand\" background-color=\"light-blue\" accent-color=\"grey\">\n    <p=\"true\"=\"\" role=\"textbox\">Bonj's strong student engagement stems from two sources. The first is found in the\n      video itself. She is a natural storyteller who knows exactly where she wants to take\n      you. What she chooses to show is fascinating; she uses graphic overlays, text, and\n      other visual cues to constantly guide the viewer; and her narration is excellent\n      in maintaining interest.The second source is too rarely seen. Consistent with the\n      guidelines to maximize student learning (see Brame's design for active learning),\n      every LARCH 060 lecture is associated with one or more Check Your Understanding questions.\n      These \"no stakes\" interactive questions allow students to test their understanding,\n      providing useful feedback to direct student interaction with the video.\n      <p></p>\n    </p=\"true\"=\"\">\n  </a11y-collapse>\n\n\n\n</grid-plate>\n<video-player accent-color=\"orange\" dark crossorigin=\"anonymous\" source=\"https://youtu.be/6QPBmX-BRyc\" track=\"https://haxtheweb.org/files/HAXshort.vtt\" sticky-corner=\"none\" resource=\"#2c67eecc-b7a0-dcbd-17d9-3eb7b7449be4\" prefix=\"oer:http://oerschema.org/ schema:http://schema.org/ dc:http://purl.org/dc/terms/ foaf:http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ cc:http://creativecommons.org/ns# bib:http://bib.schema.org \" element-visible lang=\"en\" media-title=\"Case Study: Super Metroid\" text-align=\"center\" style=\"background-color: var(--simple-colors-default-theme-null-1);

Make your introduction\n    compelling and motivate them to continue watching all the way through.

The slides don't need to present your narrative; your narration is already\n    doing that. That said, text does play a role, which we will explain below. First,\n    though, start with these general guidelines:\n    <br>\n  </p>\n<ul>\n    <li =\"true\"=\"\"><b>Don't</b>\nput a significant amount of text on any of your slides</li>\n    <li =\"true\"=\"\"><b>Don't</b>\noutline your presentation on the slides themselves; keep this in your\n      notes</li>\n    <li =\"true\"=\"\"><b>Don't</b>\nread your slide text to your students!</li>\n  </ul>\n<h5 id=\"header-99e9a568-4c7e-e0e7-8e7f-445e84464a29\" data-original-level=\"H4\">Use Bullet Points and Brief Wording</h5>\n<ul>\n    <li =\"true\"=\"\">Use bullet points rather than complete sentences or paragraphs</li>\n    <li =\"true\"=\"\">Use text to reinforce or highlight key concepts and takeaways</li>\n    <li =\"true\"=\"\">Provide the details in the narration</li>\n    <li =\"true\"=\"\">Treat your slides like billboards along a highway: students should be able to take\n      away the main ideas in three seconds or less</li>\n  </ul>\n<h5 id=\"header-c46b1453-1d85-ceae-8f24-c742cf41e482\" data-original-level=\"H4\">Avoid Data Dumps of Numerical Information</h5>\n<p>When displaying data, avoid a \"data dump\". Complex tables require much effort to\n    read and understand.

ODL can provide you with a&#160;quality external\n    microphone for use in our studio or your office. <b>The quality of microphone is the most important factor in recording.</b>\n\n    <br>\n      <br>Take time to experiment a bit before launching into recording. Use an application\n      (we like Audacity) that shows you the recording levels. You can easily see when the\n      input sensitivity is too high: the levels bounce into the red and remain there, and\n      you can begin to hear sound distortion.&#160;You can also see when the input sensitivity\n      is too low: the levels never make it out of the green (even momentarily), and the\n      sounds lacks \"oomph\". Either result is frustrating to listen to.\n      <br>\n      <br>Once you have good levels, you don't need to set them again. Just maintain the same\n      physical distance from the mic and spot check your levels occasionally. <b>One last tip: after recording, use the software's normalize feature</b>\nto\n      normalize your final audio to a consistent benchmark level. Regardless of variations\n      in level during recording, this will make them all consistent in the end.</p>\n<h2 data-original-level=\"H2\" font-size=\"x-large\" background-color=\"light-blue\" padding-top=\"16\" padding-bottom=\"16\" id=\"header-0b5273df-5813-34b3-0655-a4ce95faf56c\" text-align=\"left\" margin-bottom=\"24\" padding-left=\"16\" data-design-treatment=\"bg\" data-primary=\"15\" data-text-align=\"center\" data-padding=\"s\" data-font-family=\"primary\" data-font-weight=\"medium\" data-font-size=\"m\" data-border=\"lg\" data-box-shadow=\"sm\"><b>Guideline 12</b><br><span>Eliminate visual/audio distractions (when appearing on camera).</span></h2>\n<h4 data-original-level=\"H4\" id=\"header-978a1f94-ffef-aa7c-0352-15f148f3e179\" background-color=\"blue-grey\" padding-top=\"8\" padding-bottom=\"8\" padding-right=\"8\" padding-left=\"8\">Avoid Distracting Clothing</h4>\n<p>Avoid wearing clothing that is highly reflective, or that has tight or high-contrast\n      patterns.

In a study examining student engagement with MOOC videos, researchers observed that student engagement depended on the narrator&#8217;s rate of speech. In general, student engagement increased as rate of speech increased. Don't be afraid of speaking too quickly; remember that students have control over playback speed, often choosing to listen slightly fast. Increasing narration speed appears to promote student interest.<br><br><b>Practical tips: </b>Strive for a rate of speech in the 185 to 254 words-per-minute range. Let your enthusiasm show!

Repurposing is fine, but always consider the differences between your original students and subsequent students.<br><br>For example, a video is easily created by recording a lecture you deliver in a face-to-face classroom session. But if used for an online class, it may feel less engaging than a video created specifically for online students. <b>The key to repurposing video is supplying context. </b>In&#160;the lesson page,&#160;explain where the video originated and contextualize its relevance for <span>your current students</span>.

The second group completed unrelated arithmetic\n  problems between the same video segments. This research showed the students in the\n  first group performed significantly better on subsequent tests of the material compared\n  to the second group.

For example, if a video teaches three topics, students can click entries in a topic menu to jump immediately to the start of Topic 1, 2, or 3. Not only does this give students navigational control, but it makes the instructor's content organization readily apparent, which benefits students by increasing the germane load of the lesson.</p>\n<h2 data-original-level=\"H2\" id=\"header-fafe4229-622b-6197-ca1b-16bb38102532\" font-size=\"x-large\" background-color=\"light-blue\" padding-top=\"16\" padding-bottom=\"16\" text-align=\"left\" margin-bottom=\"24\" data-design-treatment=\"bg\" data-primary=\"15\" data-text-align=\"center\" data-padding=\"s\" data-font-family=\"primary\" data-font-weight=\"medium\" data-font-size=\"m\" data-border=\"lg\" data-box-shadow=\"sm\"><b>Guideline 11</b><br>Use Guiding Questions</h2>\n<p>One research study examined the impact of guiding questions on student learning\n  from video.

Extraneous information for a novice learner may actually be helpful for a more expert learner, while information essential for a novice may serve as an already-known distraction for an expert.  It is important that the instructor consider his or her learners when weeding educational videos, including information that is necessary for their processing but eliminating information that they do not need to reach the learning goal at hand. Ibrahim et al. (2012) has shown that this treatment can improve retention and transfer of new information from video.</p>\n<p background-color=\"amber\" style=\"background-color: var(--simple-colors-default-theme-amber-1); color: var(--simple-colors-default-theme-amber-12); padding: 2px 16px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em;\" padding-top=\"2\" padding-right=\"16\" padding-bottom=\"2\" padding-left=\"16\" margin-top=\"0\" margin-right=\"0\" margin-bottom=\"0\" margin-left=\"0\" text-align=\"center\" font-size=\"large\">\n  <b>Script Your Actions as Well as Your Words</b>\n  <br data-hax-layout=\"true\">\n</p>\n<p>Another benefit of scripting: it helps you to identify the visuals you will need, and you can insert bracketed comments [CLICK] to remind you when to carry out your actions.</p>\n<p background-color=\"amber\" style=\"background-color: var(--simple-colors-default-theme-amber-1); color: var(--simple-colors-default-theme-amber-12); padding: 2px 16px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em;\" padding-top=\"2\" padding-right=\"16\" padding-bottom=\"2\" padding-left=\"16\" margin-top=\"0\" margin-right=\"0\" margin-bottom=\"0\" margin-left=\"0\" text-align=\"center\" font-size=\"large\">\n  <b>Leverage Your Time and Effort</b>\n  <br data-hax-layout=\"true\">\n</p>\n<p>Writing a script is an investment of time and effort, so leverage that investment wisely.

In contrast, showing the animation while also showing printed text uses only the visual channel and thus overloads this channel and impedes learning (Mayer and Moreno, 2003). In another example, using a \"talking head\" video to explain a complex process makes productive use only of the verbal channel (watching the speaker does not provide additional information), whereas a Khan Academy--style tutorial that provides symbolic sketches to illustrate the verbal explanation uses both channels to give complementary information. Using both channels to convey appropriate and complementary information has been shown to increase students' retention and ability to transfer information and to increase student engagement with videos.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li data-hax-layout=\"true\"=\"true\">Source: URL or other location where you found the content.</li>\n  <li data-hax-layout=\"true\"=\"true\">Citation Info: For example, for an image you would want to capture the image creator's name, image title, date of creation, date posted online, date of access, institution where located, website or database name.</li>\n  <li data-hax-layout=\"true\"=\"true\">Accessibility Info: Images and media will need alternative text, captions, descriptive text, etc. Better to write and store this information together with the copyright information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p background-color=\"blue-grey\" style=\"background-color: var(--simple-colors-default-theme-blue-grey-1); color: var(--simple-colors-default-theme-blue-grey-12); padding: 2px 16px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em;\" padding-top=\"2\" padding-right=\"16\" padding-bottom=\"2\" padding-left=\"16\" margin-top=\"0\" margin-right=\"0\" margin-bottom=\"0\" margin-left=\"0\" text-align=\"center\" font-size=\"large\">\n  <b>Document Copyright Clearance Required</b>\n  <br data-hax-layout=\"true\">\n</p>\n<p>A full treatment of copyright compliance is beyond the scope here; see the resource links below.

Seemingly out of nowhere, this model of bridge has become hugely popular for anyone who wants a new bridge.

It was widely used in World\n                  War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War.</p><p>Designed by John Browning, the M1911 is the best-known of\n                  his designs to use the short recoil principle in its basic\n                  design. The pistol was widely copied, and this operating\n                  system rose to become the preeminent type of the 20th century\n                  and of nearly all modern centerfire pistols.</p><p>Following its success in trials, the Colt pistol was formally\n                  adopted by the Army on March 29, 1911, when it was designated\n                  Model of 1911, later changed to Model 1911, in 1917, and then\n                  M1911, in the mid-1920s. The Director of Civilian Marksmanship\n                  began manufacture of M1911 pistols for members of the National\n                  Rifle Association in August 1912. Approximately 100 pistols\n                  stamped \"N.R.A.\" below the serial number were manufactured at\n                  Springfield Armory and by Colt. The M1911 was formally\n                  adopted by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps in 1913. The .45 ACP\n                  \"Model of 1911 U.S. Army\" was used by both US Army Cavalry\n                  Troops and Infantry Soldiers during the United States'\n                  Punitive Expedition into Mexico against Pancho Villa in\n                  1916.\n                </p><p>By the beginning of 1917, a total of 68,533 M1911 pistols had\n                  been delivered to U.S. armed forces by Colt's Patent Firearms\n                  Manufacturing Company and the U.S. government's Springfield\n                  Armory.\n                </p>\n                \n  \n      \n      <div id=\"images\" slot=\"images\">\n                  \n    \n        \n        <media-image source=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/master/elements/course-model/demo/models/guns/img/colt1911-1.jpeg\" figure-label-title=\"1.1\" figure-label-description=\"This is\n                    the description of the figure.\" alt=\"Descriptive image text\n                    here.\" size=\"wide\" offset=\"none\" modal-title=\"1.1 - This is\n                    the description of the figure.\">\n                  </media-image>\n                  \n    \n        \n        <media-image source=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/master/elements/course-model/demo/models/guns/img/colt1911-2.png\" figure-label-title=\"2.1\" figure-label-description=\"This is\n                    the description of the figure.\" alt=\"Descriptive image text\n                    here.\" size=\"wide\" offset=\"none\" modal-title=\"2.1 - This is\n                    the description of the figure.\">\n                  </media-image>\n                  \n    \n        \n        <media-image source=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/master/elements/course-model/demo/models/guns/img/colt1911-3.jpeg\" figure-label-title=\"2.2\" figure-label-description=\"This is\n                    the description of the figure.\" alt=\"Descriptive image text\n                    here.\" size=\"wide\" offset=\"none\" modal-title=\"2.2 - This is\n                    the description of the figure.\">\n                  </media-image>\n                \n  \n      \n      </div>\n              \n    \n    </model-info>\n  \n  </span><span slot=\"animation\">\n    \n    <video-player source=\"https://youtu.be/JzXMrzvh1UM\" accent-color=\"grey\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" sticky-corner=\"none\" resource=\"#50ccf545-b30a-ac20-76a3-cdd164f66569\" prefix=\"oer:http://oerschema.org/ schema:http://schema.org/ dc:http://purl.org/dc/terms/ foaf:http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ cc:http://creativecommons.org/ns# bib:http://bib.schema.org \" t=\"{&quot;embeddedMedia&quot;:&quot;embedded media&quot;}\" source-type=\"youtube\" lang=\"en\" sources=\"[]\" source-data=\"[{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JzXMrzvh1UM&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;&quot;}]\" tracks=\"[]\">\n              </video-player>\n  \n  </span><span slot=\"check\">\n    \n    <iframe src=\"https://media.ed.science.psu.edu/h5p/embed/5783?entity_iframe=1\" width=\"950\" height=\"350\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n&#60;script&#62;&#60;/script&#62;\n  \n  </span><span slot=\"logo\">\n    \n    <img title=\"ECOS Office of Digital Learning\" id=\"brand\" src=\"img/ecosodl.png\" alt=\"The Office of Digital Learning\"/>\n  \n  </span></course-model>\n<p></p>\n"

It does this by taking a screen shot of the gif (or allowing you to supply one) and then creating an interaction where the user has to click Play on the GIF in order to see it playing. This is a great example of the simple ways that HAX can improve the default accessibility of the web by eliminating the ability for users to cause an accessibility issue in the first place!</p>\n<h4 data-original-level=\"H4\" id=\"header-fe34c00d-1c07-b1d0-38bf-3f02920684df\">Example</h4>\n<grid-plate disable-responsive layout=\"1-1\" responsive-size=\"md\" breakpoint-sm=\"900\" breakpoint-md=\"1200\" breakpoint-lg=\"1500\" breakpoint-xl=\"1800\" item-padding=\"8\" style=\"--grid-plate-item-padding: 8px;\">\n  <h2 id=\"header-f8db2927-293b-580e-496b-6948f454ff2e\">Great gifs</h2>\n  <a11y-gif-player alt=\"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia Pepe Silvia Meme with GIFs\" src=\"https://media0.giphy.com/media/zHaPZZvl6cVHi/giphy.gif\" longdesc=\"Pepe Silvia scene from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

You can read more about this in the <a href=\"https://dev.to/btopro/uwc-part-3-the-magic-script-122a\" target=\"_blank\">Dev.to blog series about how Penn State ships web components</a>\n. The magic script, extended since the original article was written, operates in the following order:</p>\n<ul><li>Tests if <code>wc-registry.json</code>\n exists locally and loads all assets locally</li>\n<li>If it doesn't exist (this is the default when downloading to NOT have all these assets), it falls-back to the Penn State CDN copy of&#160;wc-registry.json</li>\n<li>If that doesn't work it attempts to fall-back to a 3rd party CDN mirror</li>\n<li>If that fails, it fails to hydrate the site</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"header-91bd2404-6c16-4190-c5b9-04df9dd0253e\">Working with local copies for deploying without CDN usage</h2>\n<p>If you wish your site to be 100% self contained and NOT rely on our CDN to hydrate, then you'll want to copy and include the following files on your server:</p>\n<ul><li>the build directory from HAXcms</li>\n<li>the wc-registry.json file from HAXcms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Place this folder and file in the root of your site and it will operate completely agnostic of changes to the CDN managed to keep sites on the latest copy of assets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"header-dad1ae52-9e59-fb6e-7577-d35ebe650f1d\">Deploy to github page</h2>\n<p>No configuration beyond getting the files up on github should be necessary. Just make sure when configuring the Settings for your repo that you point to the <code>main</code>\n / <code>master</code>\n branch as opposed to <code>gh-pages</code>\n branch for serving your site.</p>\n<h2 id=\"header-9d4229ff-52fb-fe52-1e8e-7b6ce2e567d8\">Deploy to surge.sh</h2>\n<p><code>surge.sh .</code>\n should be all you need in order to publish a newly downloaded folder to surge. This is because of the magic script's defaults matching surge!</p>\n<h2 id=\"header-7ba89033-9662-3ed6-3aa1-3f85d7197001\">Download and unzip on a server</h2>\n<p>Downloading HAX sites allows you to take your site with you at the click of a button by unzipping it onto your own hosting service. Here are some considerations of that:</p>\n<ul><li>Your domain name change might mean that if you hard coded links in your content, you'll want to search and replace them</li>\n<li>If your host serves static files, you should be good with the default configuration, but if the host has <code>PHP</code>\n running on it you might want to consider having a copy of HAXcms on the server. This is because the default <code>.htaccess</code>\n file settings prioritize loading <code>index.php</code>\n over the included <code>index.html</code>\n . You'll want to make sure that you change this setting OR review the top of the <code>index.php</code>\n file for where to store a copy of HAXcms on your server. The advantage of having <code>PHP</code>\n based hosting is that it will improve SEO scores / initial load performance due to being able to hint to the browser what content is coming.</li>\n<li>It is not recommended modifying the <code>index.php</code>\n file as it is managed and will change in future downloads / exports, but the paths mentioned can be modified in order to load HAXcms dynamically if your hosting / path provider requires that you store these elsewhere</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"header-129519de-db21-cbef-718d-541ece302507\">Customizing downloaded site CSS/JS</h2>\n<p>In all sites there is a backdoor file for adding custom CSS and JS. These files have defaults (of nothing) but load so that if you want to make hard-coded changes you can inject customized JS and CSS. For JS <code>custom/build/custom.es6.js</code>\n is the file you'll want to modify and for CSS <code>theme/theme.css</code>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n"

They could have\n    looked great from day one, but we might not have a day two to build in if we did!</li>\n  <li data-hax-layout=\"true\" =\"true\"=\"\"=\"true\"><b>Design</b>\n: Everything in HAX will begin to feel intentionally designed. This\n    is because of the standardization of CSS variables, spacing and other naming considerations.\n    All of the things invisible to our users will be leveraged to ensure that anyone\n    and everyone gets a well designed experience.</li>\n    <li data-hax-layout=\"true\" =\"true\"=\"\"=\"true\"><b>Destroy</b>\n: With a rock solid development pattern, and a rock solid design pattern,\n      we are able to start destroying connotations of what HAX is, what it can do, and\n      the types of sites it can create. We don't want to be another brand in a marketplace\n      of inaccessible, high energy consumption, expensive web. We want to destroy the web\n      as it was and recreate a new web that works for everyone regardless of resources\n      or abilities! A more inclusive web than we have today; <i>we want to HAX The Web</i>\n.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>DDD seeks to solve a long standing criticism of web components and the HAX ecosystem\n  more broadly, that it feels created and implemented by many people building in similar\n  yet different ways. The resources used to build HAX over many years has created this\n  problem; but fortunately, there is a solution. DDD is that solution, by creating\n  a unified theory of css variables, classes and spacing, we can retroactively update\n  existing HAX properties and HAX blocks to feel like they were all built at the same\n  time.</p>\n<h2 data-original-level=\"H2\" id=\"header-95d7a00e-9e94-e2d0-c9f5-2f970f5deca0\">How does this work?</h2>\n<p>HAX is primarily built on LitElement, a baseClass JavaScript library called Lit\n  that we use to standardize our development experience. Lit makes things fast, small,\n  and simple to read in the web components universe that is HAX. Because of this standardization,\n  we can build a new baseClass that has baked in assumptions about spacing, color,\n  and design. Previously we had this in a class called SimpleColors. SimpleColors provided\n  a unified color theory to all things HAX. You'll see it at times when there is an\n  \"Accent Color\" or \"Dark mode\" flag on elements. This is because they inherit from\n  the same base of colors and css variables, then implemented in that element.</p>\n<p>DDD then is a new base class that builds on top of SimpleColors to mix color in\n  with fonts, spacing, borders, additional color pallets, breakpoints, and more to\n  produce a consistent way of building and communicating blocks in HAX. In-fact the\n  theme you are reading on right now is built using DDD which is why it feels consistent\n  and cleanly spaced.</p>\n<h2 data-original-level=\"H2\" id=\"header-49c52575-9f63-be23-8850-7ba272794fa2\">DDD - Develop, Design, Destroy</h2>\n<p>Below is the guide to DDD, built using the DDD based class itself. This ensures\n  that this guide is always up to date as we push out changes! This is currently a\n  highly functional work in progress but is not considered API stable or API complete.\n  HAX 9 should provide the pathway toward DDD reaching beta in which it is API stable,\n  but in the midst of clean up.</p>\n<d-d-docs accent-color=\"grey\" option=\"*\" options=\"[&quot;Borders&quot;,&quot;Breakpoints&quot;,&quot;DefaultColors&quot;,&quot;DefaultFunctionalColors&quot;,&quot;Gradients&quot;,&quot;Radius&quot;,&quot;Shadows&quot;,&quot;Spacing&quot;,&quot;Typography&quot;,&quot;RichText&quot;,&quot;Buttons&quot;,&quot;InstructionalComponents&quot;,&quot;PageSections&quot;]\"></d-d-docs>\n"

The magic script is a standard way of dynamically discovering and importing the definitions of web components on the fly. We leverage this approach in all of our HAX platform integrations because it simplifies the initial question of how to teach the CMS / app about web components.</p>\n<p>There's an entire <a href=\"https://dev.to/btopro/uwc-part-3-the-magic-script-122a\">Dev.to Series about our integration</a>  methodology if you'd like more detail about why we do this or how it works. The integration methodology is a stand alone repo you can use for custom builds, found in our <a href=\"https://github.com/haxtheweb/unbundled-webcomponents\">Unbundled Web components repo</a> . Below is what is recommended if you want to leverage our CDN and wide array of elements we already include in our builds.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/elmsln/hax-all-the-things\">HAX All the Things</a>  repo has every integration we support as well as some examples of including HAX in Angular and other frameworks (see platform folder in that repo). For a common CMS integration example see this part of the WordPress plugin (code below)</p>\n<h2 data-original-level=\"H2\" id=\"header-e600e621-e4b7-f430-1e79-b390295747fc\">WordPress integration example</h2>\n<code-sample copy-clipboard-button type=\"javascript\">\n  \n<template preserve-content=\"preserve-content\">(function ($) {\n$(document).ready(function () {\n    // HAX the Press\n    var haxThePress = document.createElement('wysiwyg-hax');\n    var temp = document.createElement('template');\n    // target the TinyMCE area\n    const content = document.querySelector('textarea#content');\n    // replicate what it was providing to the light DOM\n    haxThePress.fieldClass = 'wp-editor-area';\n    haxThePress.fieldName = 'content';\n    haxThePress.fieldId = 'content';\n    haxThePress.openDefault = true;\n    haxThePress.elementAlign = 'left';\n    haxThePress.saveButtonSelector = document.querySelector('input[type=\"submit\"]#publish');\n    if (window.haxThePressConnector) {\n      haxThePress.appStoreConnection = window.haxThePressConnector;\n    }\n    // set the template tag to the content previously in the textarea\n    temp.innerHTML = content.value;\n    // append the template tag into the wysiwyg\n    haxThePress.appendChild(temp.cloneNode(true));\n    // insert the field exactly where the tinymce was\n    content.parentNode.insertBefore(haxThePress, content);\n    // HAX the web\n    content.parentNode.removeChild(content);\n});\n})(jQuery);</template></code-sample>\n<p>In this example we can see that WordPress is able to integrate with the wysiwyg-hax tag by using jQuery to correctly time when the WordPress loaded DOM is ready, then replacing the \"content\" area (a textarea with) at run time with our light-dom capable wysiwyg-hax tag.</p>\n<h2 data-original-level=\"H2\" id=\"header-aafa9147-e7a1-cebd-625f-1fc9dc9c1601\">General integration advisement</h2>\n<p>HAXeditor keeps so much functionality on the front-end that there's really very little tying it to..well.. anything. As a result, HAX is easy to integrate into systems that currently have WYSIWYG capabilities.</p>\n<p>All integrations effectively boil down to four things</p>\n<ol><li>End point to load content</li> <li>End point to save content</li> <li>End point to load the appstore specification</li> <li>End point to upload files (optional)</li></ol>\n<h2 data-original-level=\"H2\" id=\"header-a419f05a-4b55-a431-76b8-e36f9a696732\">Content filtering</h2>\n<p>Because web components are valid HTML tags your system may accept them when saved into your database but you may also be doing tag filtering or other XSS sanitation prior to storage. If you do process prior to storage (and you should) but it strips the web components out of the mark up, you'll need to add some filtering / white-listing capabilities to your system in order to ensure that the web component html tags pass through that should.</p>\n"

OER Schema adds a vocabulary of terms that expands the Google developed Schema.org vocabulary to include pedagogical terms that anyone can apply to their own learning content.

Our goal is to unify OER content on the web to a standard vocabulary in effort to enhance its discoverability in public and private indexes and allow content to be more easily remixed and re-purposed.\n</p>\n<h2 data-original-level=\"H2\" class=\"h4\" id=\"header-6ff6b18d-3b9d-d495-fa84-e1353a560ace\">What is a Schema?</h2>\n<p>In short, a schema is just metadata, or information about information. While computers are great at processing and calculating great amounts of information, they lack contextual understanding innate to human beings. A schema, in our case an RDF vocabulary, allows developers to apply human concepts to marked-up information, typically using HTML, so that software applications can determine the context of the information and contextual relationships pieces of content have with one another. A schema ensures a common understanding about the information being processed.</p>\n<h2 data-original-level=\"H2\" class=\"h4\" id=\"header-701f5a6c-a18a-6a76-9471-5596664fe7da\">How do I use the OER Schema?</h2>\n<p>Ideally, an Instructional Designer or Faculty Member won't have to worry about implementing the schema; rather, they should petition the content delivery platforms they use to implement this schema for them. However, if you are skilled in HTML or are a developer looking to implement this schema, you can follow along with some examples below.</p>\n<h3 data-original-level=\"H3\" class=\"h4 grey-text text-darken-2\" id=\"header-d8f6caa3-4726-e5d5-9548-a171b18c85e7\">Understanding Schema Relationships</h3>\n<p>Before we get into the meat and potatoes of how to implement the schema, it helps to understand how it is organized and how things relate to one another. After all, a good reason to use the schema is to build relationships between the parts of your content.</p>\n<p>Looking at the\n  <a href=\"/docs/schema.html\">schema</a>\npage, you'll notice the a list of items, some nested deeper than others. These items are called\n  <strong>types</strong>\nand the structured format they are listed in represents a\n  <strong>hierarchical tree</strong>\n. At the top of this tree is the first\n  <strong>type</strong>\n, named a\n  <a href=\"/Resource\">Resource</a>\n. Resource is the\n  <strong>parent</strong>\nof all the types indented below it. Each\n  <strong>child</strong>\nin the tree extends its parent, meaning it gains all of the\n  <strong>properties</strong>\nof the parent and its parent's parents. A child can also be used in cases when its parent type is specified.\n</p>\n<h4 data-original-level=\"H4\" class=\"h4 grey-text text-lighten-1\" id=\"header-eab1d6ab-dcfe-bb18-8e64-842a6280fe85\">Types</h4>\n<p>Often times a\n  <strong>type</strong>\nis thought of as an object or a noun. A type says what something is. When you apply a type to a section of content, you're saying that the content is of that type. In the case of the OER Schema, you could specify that something is a\n  <a href=\"/Course\">Course</a>\n.\n</p>\n<h4 data-original-level=\"H4\" class=\"h4 grey-text text-lighten-1\" id=\"header-b93af602-55fe-c147-7923-c8d9c0a24ea9\">Properties</h4>\n<p>If a\n  <strong>type</strong>\nis a noun, a\n  <strong>property</strong>\nwould be an adjective in that\n  <strong>properties describe the type</strong>\n. Looking at\n  <a href=\"/Course\">Course</a>\n, you'll notice a list of properties, some for the Course type itself and other inherited from the\n  <a href=\"/Resource\">Resource</a>\ntype as well as external vocabulary types from\n  <a href=\"http://schema.org/\" target=\"_blank\">schema.org</a>\n.\n</p>\n<p>A property is associated with one or more types and has a\n  <strong>value</strong>\nand the value, itself, has a type. In the properties table for\n  <a href=\"/Course\">Course</a>\n, there is an \"Expected Type\" column, which denotes the expected type for the value of the property. Sometimes this type is simply\n  <a href=\"/Text\">Text</a>\nor\n  <a href=\"/Number\">Number</a>\n, i.e. \"Some Text\" or \"1\", and other times the expected type is another type in the schema, like\n  <a href=\"/LearningComponent\">LearningComponent</a>\n. In the case of\n  <a href=\"/LearningComponent\">LearningComponent</a>\n, the value could be\n  <a href=\"/LearningComponent\">LearningComponent</a>\nor any of its child types such as\n  <a href=\"/LearningObject\">LearningObjective</a>\nor\n  <a href=\"/Lesson\">Lesson</a>\n.\n</p>\n<h3 data-original-level=\"H3\" class=\"h4 grey-text text-darken-2\" id=\"header-bf64861b-d953-add4-f00a-fc2b365f2458\">Applying the Schema</h3>\n<p>In the following examples, we will use\n  <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-lite/\" target=\"_blank\">RDFa Lite 1.1</a>\nto apply the schema to HTML 5 markup. There are a number of ways to apply an RDF vocabulary to HTML. Some alternatives to RDFa Lite is\n  <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/html-rdfa/\" target=\"_blank\">HTML+RDFa 1.1</a>\nand\n  <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/microdata-rdf/\">Microdata</a>\n. Whichever way you prefer is completely up to you.\n</p>\n<h4 data-original-level=\"H4\" class=\"h4 grey-text text-lighten-1\" id=\"header-d8dbafbf-9e58-48ca-b7ff-d5ffafbf371c\">RDFa Lite 1.1</h4>\n<p>RDFa is an acronym for\n  <strong>Resource Document Framework in attributes</strong>\n. RDFa allows us to apply RDF vocabularies to HTML using attributes on HTML 5 tags. Which tags? Any tags. The attributes used in RDFa can be applied to any tag used to markup content, though more commonly\n  <code>&#60;span&#62;</code>\nand\n  <code>&#60;div&#62;</code>\ntags are used.\n</p>\n<p>The following attributes are used to apply RDFa to HTML:</p>\n<dl>\n  <dt>\n    <b>vocab=\"\"</b>\n  </dt>\n  <dd>\nThe\n    <code>vocab</code>\nattribute specified the root URL of the vocabulary you would like to apply. The vocabulary is applied to the element itself and all child elements. For this reason, the vocab attribute is commonly applied to the\n    <code>&#60;body&#62;</code>\ntag.\n    <pre>      <code class=\"hljs html\">\n        <span class=\"hljs-comment\">&#60;!-- http://example.com/my-course.html --&#62;</span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">body</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">vocab</span>=\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"http://oerschema.org\"</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-comment\">&#60;!-- ... --&#62;</span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;/\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">body</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n      </code>\n    </pre>\n  </dd>\n  <dt>\n    <b>typeof=\"\"</b>\n  </dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>The\n      <code>typeof</code>\nattribute allows you to specify which\n      <strong>type</strong>\nyou want to apply to the element.\n    </p>\n    <pre>      <code class=\"hljs html\">\n        <span class=\"hljs-comment\">&#60;!-- http://example.com/my-course.html --&#62;</span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">body</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">vocab</span>=\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"http://oerschema.org\"</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">typeof</span>=\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Course\"</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">h2</span>&#62;\n        </span>My Course\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;/\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">h2</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">p</span>&#62;\n        </span>A description of my course.\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;/\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">p</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-comment\">&#60;!-- ... --&#62;</span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;/\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;/\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">body</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n      </code>\n    </pre>\n  </dd>\n  <dt>\n    <b>property=\"\"</b>\n  </dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>The\n      <code>property</code>\nattribute is used to specify which property to use for the associated\n      <strong>type</strong>\n.

We've described the Course object using the\n      <code>courseIdentifier</code>\nand\n      <code>description</code>\nproperties. The values of these properties is the content of their respective elements. So\n      <code>courseIdentifier</code>\n's value is\n      <code>My Course</code>\nand\n      <code>description</code>\n's value is\n      <code>A description of my course.</code>\n    </p>\n    <p>Take notice of the\n      <code>&#60;img&#62;</code>\nelement. The value of the property attribute is a URL to a property found in schema.org. Since\n      <a href=\"/Course\">Course</a>\nis a child of\n      <a href=\"/Resource\">Resource</a>\nwhich also extends\n      <a href=\"http://schema.org/Thing\">http://schema.org/Thing</a>\n, all of the properties of http://schema.org/Thing can also be used on\n      <a href=\"/Course\">Course</a>\n, but since they exist in a different vocabulary, you have to provide the full URL path of the property. In this case, the value of the\n      <code>http://schema.org/image</code>\nproperty is actually the value of the\n      <code>src</code>\nparameter,\n      <code>/path/to/my/image.jpg</code>\n. Later, you'll see how to use\n      <code>prefixes</code>\nwith the\n      <code>vocab</code>\nattribute to make it easier to use multiple libraries.\n    </p>\n  </dd>\n  <dt>\n    <b>resource=\"\"</b>\n  </dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>So far, we've created a\n      <a href=\"/Course\">Course</a>\nobject and applied some attributes to it. But how do we reference this object? Enter the\n      <code>resource</code>\nattribute. Without the\n      <code>resource</code>\nattribute, you must use the full URL of the HTML page as a reference, but this makes this complicated when there are multiple objects on a page and they need to reference one another.\n    </p>\n    <p>What do I mean by reference? I mean create a relationship. The\n      <code>resource</code>\nattribute allows an object to have be identified for use as a value of a\n      <strong>property</strong>\n. Let's see an example:\n    </p>\n    <pre>      <code class=\"hljs html\">\n        <span class=\"hljs-comment\">&#60;!-- http://example.com/my-course.html --&#62;</span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">body</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">vocab</span>=\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"http://oerschema.org\"</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">typeof</span>=\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Course\"</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">resource</span>=\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"#my-course\"</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">h2</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">property</span>=\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"courseIdentifier\"</span>&#62;\n        </span>My Course\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;/\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">h2</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">p</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">property</span>=\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"description\"</span>&#62;\n        </span>A description of my course.\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;/\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">p</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">img</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">src</span>=\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"/path/to/my/image.jpg\"</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">property</span>=\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"http://schema.org/image\"</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-comment\">&#60;!-- ... --&#62;</span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;/\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;/\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">body</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n      </code>\n    </pre>\n    <p>First, notice the\n      <code>#</code>\nprefix on the resource name. Essentially, the\n      <code>resource</code>\nis the unique URL of the object. On the web, the URL gets you to the page, but a page anchor, which starts with the prefix\n      <code>#</code>\n, takes you to the element on the page. So by prefixing our resource name with\n      <code>#</code>\n, we're just saying that this is the element on the page with this ID.\n    </p>\n    <p>Next, we need to put it to good use. In the following example, you'll see how the\n      <code>resource</code>\nattribute and its value play a role with mapping a schema object as a value of a property in another object on the same page.\n    </p>\n    <pre>      <code class=\"hljs html\">\n        <span class=\"hljs-comment\">&#60;!-- http://example.com/my-course.html --&#62;</span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">body</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">vocab</span>=\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"http://oerschema.org\"</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">typeof</span>=\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Course\"</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">resource</span>=\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"#my-course\"</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">h2</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">property</span>=\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"courseIdentifier\"</span>&#62;\n        </span>My Course\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;/\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">h2</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">p</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">property</span>=\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"description\"</span>&#62;\n        </span>A description of my course.\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;/\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">p</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">img</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">src</span>=\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"/path/to/my/image.jpg\"</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">property</span>=\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"http://schema.org/image\"</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-comment\">&#60;!-- ... --&#62;</span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">link</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">property</span>=\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"primaryInstructor\"</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">href</span>=\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"#instructor\"</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;/\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">typeof</span>=\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Person\"</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">resource</span>=\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"#instructor\"</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">h2</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">property</span>=\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"name\"</span>&#62;\n        </span>Dr. Bob Jones\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;/\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">h2</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">p</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">property</span>=\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"description\"</span>&#62;\n        </span>An instructor at a university somewhere.\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;/\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">p</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;/\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#60;/\n          <span class=\"hljs-name\">body</span>&#62;\n        </span>\n      </code>\n    </pre>\n    <p>Now we've created another object,\n      <a href=\"/Person\">Person</a>\n, as a sibling to\n      <a href=\"/Course\">Course</a>\n.

Think Google Apps but for colleges, institutions or even individual professors to run and control a course that best meets their needs to effectively teach their topics. An ecosystem of educational technologies that know how to work together, utilize industry standards like REST, xAPI and LTI(1.2) and can grow infinitely because of the philosophy of the design (yes, infinitely). Each course forms a network of technologies (hence the name Learning Network) which can then be better tailored to each individual course's needs.</p>\n<p>ELMS:LN as both idea and platform has been developed and in use since 2012 to power the content and experiences of 100s of online courses at Penn State and beyond. In 2020 HAXcms matured to the point that it began to replace ELMS:LN's design layer. By 2022 all direct development on ELMS:LN effectively stopped as all new capabilities were added into HAX, which was then loaded on top of ELMS:LN.</p>\n<p>ELMS:LN is effectively in legacy. It is still used but all new development happens in HAX and then is backported via a script to make these capabilities available in ELMS:LN. It is effectively feature and version complete yet will continue to get updates via HAXcms for awhile given the unique way the integration was executed (tricking HAXcms front-end into thinking that Drupal is serving it static files).</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/elmsln/elmsln\" target=\"_blank\">Github Repo</a>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://elmsln.org/\" target=\"_parent\">Legacy community site</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n"

This ensures that HAX produced sites and pages will work forever.</p>\n<h3 id=\"header-aef5ee7c-cb38-6e0b-12a3-b49d98baf557\">October 2023 Horizon Video</h3>\n<video-player source=\"https://youtu.be/bX04I1Cw9FA\" caption=\"https://youtu.be/bX04I1Cw9FA\" accent-color=\"grey\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" sticky-corner=\"none\" resource=\"#fb500920-d257-449b-85ea-c8416306d280\" prefix=\"oer:http://oerschema.org/ schema:http://schema.org/ dc:http://purl.org/dc/terms/ foaf:http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ cc:http://creativecommons.org/ns# bib:http://bib.schema.org \" element-visible lang=\"en\" t=\"{&quot;embeddedMedia&quot;:&quot;embedded media&quot;}\" source-type=\"youtube\" sources=\"[]\" source-data=\"[{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bX04I1Cw9FA&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;&quot;}]\" tracks=\"[]\"></video-player>\n<h4 id=\"header-a937a470-6ef2-a1d3-f0cd-4914df5dc1f2\">Image discussed in the video</h4>\n<media-image source=\"files/hax-horizon-report-oct-2023.jpg\" alt=\"files/hax-horizon-report-oct-2023.jpg\" size=\"wide\" offset=\"none\" card citation=\"October 2023 HAX Horizon Report\" caption=\"Media discussed in the HAX Horizon Report that is helping to drive the discussion around related prototypes and other existing tools.\" modal-title=\"Media discussed in the HAX Horizon Report that is helping to drive the discussion around related prototypes and other existing tools.\" _has-caption></media-image>\n<p></p>\n"
